# Applied-Databases 

This repository contains a project I completed for my applied databases module as part of my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics. 

<br>

## Overview 
In this repository you will find the following folders:

- `Innovation` - this contains a pdf with explainations on how I completed the 3 sections of the project with some references to added to support my research. 

- `MySQL-Queries` - this folder contains 6 txt files which contain the SQL commands I wrote to complete the SQL questions for this project. I have also included a pdf of the questions in this folder. 

- `Neo4j-Queries` - this folder contains 6 txt files which contain the Neo4j commands I wrote to complete the Neo4j section of this project. I have also included a pdf of the questions in this folder. 

- `PythonApp` - this folder contains 2 python files. 
    - The first app.py contains functions I created for the python part of this project as per the specification below. The idea of the application if that when run it displays a menu and from there the user can choose what they wish to do.  
    - The second python file appDB.py contains all my SQL commands which are imported and called in the app.py file. 

    The concept of this application is to use python to connect and interact with a database using SQL commands.

## The Project
The goal of this project was to learn how to use SQL and Neo4j commands to answer a desired question. It also required me to build a python programme to interact with a SQL Database and use python to perform SQL queries on the command line. Furthermore, I was tasked with creating an interactive environment within my python app so that a user could make such queries and interact with my Database using this application.

## Conclusion
I found this project quite enjoyable to complete.  I feel I gained invaluable experince using python alongside SQL and Neo4j to connect and interat with databases. I have given my explainations in the innovation.pdf which includes references for where I sourced my answers. Overall, this was one of my favourite modules. In the future I would like to look at my python files again, maybe tidy them up to compact my code further.
